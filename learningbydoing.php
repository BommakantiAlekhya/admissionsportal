<p class="mb30" align="justify">The methodology of “Learning By Doing” is a unique one adopted by MSIT. It aims at giving hands - on experience which helps the students understand the practical implementation aspects and the concepts associated with it.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">MSIT’s “Learning by Doing” method involves learning in a project-centric way. This helps students to solve problems by applying concepts. 
Each course is broken into manageable modules each of which is offered as a project to be worked on. Students work in teams with a corporate-like environment. The students understand the concept while working on the project and submit the relevant tasks (deliverables) within the deadline specified by their mentors.
The students get the required guidance and support at every level from the mentors who have a wide knowledge base which enhances the knowledge of the students.
Each course is offered by a principal mentor and the student: mentor ratio at MSIT stands out to be 10:1 giving enough scope for the students to interact with their mentor whenever required. Personalized mentoring at MSIT aims at nurturing the students in every way.
Students are given individual workstations with laptops and 24x7 internet facilities. Rich digital content with strong audio-visual support alongside constant mentoring provides them with the necessary platform, with lectures by eminent people also.
Therefore, MSIT students gain hands-on experience from innovative learning solutions. </p>

                                <span ><p class="mb30" align="justify">MSIT employs a unique ‘Sequential Learning’ technique by which a student only moves on to the next course after thoroughly mastering the preceding course as against the conventional BTECH/MTECH programs which offer courses in a parallel fashion. This sequential pattern would enable a student to master one course a time, understand the relevant concepts, give him some scope to explore in depth into core concepts and move on with the next course. The Mastery Model of assessment requires a student to score 70% and above. This motivates students to stretch their abilities and reach the required target percentage. An academic year is divided into 6 mini semesters. Duration of each mini semester is eight weeks. The first year has five mini semesters of IT and Soft skills and one mini semester of practicum. The Second year has four mini semesters of IT and Soft skills, and two mini semesters of practicum. There would be a 4 - week vacation, spread over the year.
