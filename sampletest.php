    <td align="left" valign="middle" class="bodytext"><div align="justify">Sociologists predicted this situation many years                             ago: “General prosperity in a country under a                             capitalist regime depends not on the amount of wealth                             within the country, but on its ability to dispose of                             its surplus wealth.” Hence when all countries                             are fully capitalized and there are fields for exploitation,                             no country will be able to dispose of its surplus wealth.                             The capitalist system will, automatically crack. Capitalism,                             therefore, contains within itself the seeds of it to                             replace the profit – making motive industry with                             the motive of service. Things are valuable in use, not                             merely in exchange as the capitalist thinks. <br>
        <br>
    Socialism differs from Communism in                             that is a tendency not a body of dogmas. There is no                             authoritative statement of its ideals upon which all                             are agreed and it is possible for many who do not call                             themselves sociologists to sympathize with some of their                             principles. Whether under such conditions the theories                             can be put to practise is a policy of advocating the                             ownership and control of the means of production. It                             seeks to balance a rigid discipline in what affects                             the individual himself. It admits Mill’s distinction                             between self – seeking and other – regarding                             actions, but it claims that Mill’s miss –                             stated the problem by under estimating the part played                             by economists. The main aim of Socialism is the creation                             of equality, because it holds that liberty is not worth                             having without the security and equality it provides. </div></td>
