						<li>In a rapidly changing work environment which is technology- driven and customer oriented in an information based economy, the reliance on Soft Skills is more relevant than ever.
</li>
 						<li>The training is spread throughout the year and not just limited to a few days. In-house training to develop LSRW (Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing) skills, life skills training by corporate professionals and rich digital content (e-modules) represent the threefold approach adopted by MSIT.</li>
 						<li>Presentations, Group Discussions and Debates are given for weekly assessment. These are conducted by a mediator/facilitator, a Soft skills mentor who evaluates and critically analyses them and gives feedback while also providing tips for self-improvement.
</li>

 						<li>Also played are lectures by eminent speakers on life skills, motivational videos, apart from Role-Plays being conducted, to enable the students to face life boldly. Hence, a comprehensive Soft skills training turns the student to an effective solution provider.
</li>
 						<li>The latest inclusion is of theater based soft skills training methodology through which the students get acquainted with the essential business etiquette skills. They are given the freedom to think creatively and the aspect of logical as well as critical thinking is enhanced through role plays.</li>

                                <span ><p class="mb30" align="justify">MSIT employs a unique ‘Sequential Learning’ technique by which a student only moves on to the next course after thoroughly mastering the preceding course as against the conventional BTECH/MTECH programs which offer courses in a parallel fashion. This sequential pattern would enable a student to master one course a time, understand the relevant concepts, give him some scope to explore in depth into core concepts and move on with the next course. The Mastery Model of assessment requires a student to score 70% and above. This motivates students to stretch their abilities and reach the required target percentage. An academic year is divided into 6 mini semesters. Duration of each mini semester is eight weeks. The first year has five mini semesters of IT and Soft skills and one mini semester of practicum. The Second year has four mini semesters of IT and Soft skills, and two mini semesters of practicum. There would be a 4 - week vacation, spread over the year.
